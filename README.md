# leaflet-challenge
Challenge 15
For this challenge I created an html file that would call upoon my javascript file to visualize a map showcasing recent earthquakes. First I used Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the JSON dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
The I used data markers to relfect reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by various colors.
